## Requirements

For development, only the latest version of Git, Node.js and a global package manager, `npm`, are required to be installed. It is recommended to follow this order of installation as the Git Bash CLI tool can be used to run the commands needed for Node and `npm` installation.

### Git

Simply visit the [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installation page and follow the instructions for your correct OS.

### Node

- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
  Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)). Feel free to use the default options in the installer.

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v14.17.3

    $ npm --version
    7.20.0

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install -g npm@latest
